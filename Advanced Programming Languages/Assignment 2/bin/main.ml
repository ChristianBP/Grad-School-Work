open Parker.Simpl

(* This is the main entrypoint of the code. You don't need to understand
 * how it works to complete the assignment, but here's a short explanation
 * for those interested:
 *  * The first 'let' statement reads the .sim file and invokes an external
 *    parser (defined in simplparser.mly) to convert the file into an icmd
 *    structure.
 *  * The next 'let' statement calls your init_store code to create a
 *    store s from the rest of the command-line arguments. The first
 *    command-line argument gets assigned to variable "arg0", the next to
 *    "arg1", etc.
 *  * The third 'let' statement calls your exec_cmd code to execute the icmd
 *    starting in the initial store.
 *  * If the SIMPL program terminates (and your code is correct) then s2 will
 *    eventually hold the final store that results from executing the
 *    program. We then print out the value of variable "ret" as the result
 *    of the computation.
